		<p>I am a new professional in the field of cybersecurity trying to find my niche. Currently, I work as a Digital Forensics Examiner,SIEM Administrator, and Security Intelligence Analyst.<br><br> I am pursuing a Masters degree in Cybersecurity from NYU Tandon as part of the Cyber Fellowship program. I have a Bachelor of Science from California State University, Sacramento, in Computer Science with a Math minor.<br><br> I obtained several professional certifications to boost my resume but really I just love learning about computer science and security.<br><br>I have tons of fun working on projects outside of my education and job in all areas of cybersecurity. I have spent a lot of time narrowing down the areas to specialize in, but still having trouble choosing just one.<br></p>
