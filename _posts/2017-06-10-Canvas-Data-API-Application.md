Another one bites the dust. 

Sacramento State was previously using on-premises instance of BlackBoard Learn for a learning mangement application. Now, the University is making the shift to a Canvas application hosted by Amazon Web Services. When this happens the Information Security Office will once again lose its logging capabilites for another service.

Two other analysts and I are currently designing a C# application to interact with the Canvas Data API and retrieve user activity data.

With these logs, we are not only trying to detect compromised accounts through anomalous activity but also academic fraud.

donald@comp:~$ sudo apt-get update

I will be updating this post as the project progresses.
