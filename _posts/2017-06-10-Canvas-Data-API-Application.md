Another one bites the dust. 

Sacramento State was previously using on-premises instance of BlackBoard Learn for a learning mangement application. Now, the University is making the shift to a Canvas application hosted in the Amazon cloud. When this happens the Information Security Office will once again lose its logging capabilites for this service.

Two other analysts and I are currently designing a C# application to interact with the Canvas Data API and retrieve user activity data.

Unlike other logs, we are not only trying to detect compromised accounts through anomalous activity but also academic fraud.

I will be updating this post as the project progresses.
