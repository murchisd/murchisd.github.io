I am starting a project to build a simple home lab running ESXi. I want to be able to implement instances of systems like pfSense, Splunk, and Elastic Search as a learning project.

I would also like to setup a small network of vulnerable machines to continue learning offensive security techniques. 

***Hardware List***

* CPU - Xeon Processor E3 1245 v5
* Mother Board - Supermicro Micro ATX X11SSH-LN4F-O
* Memory - Samsung DDR4-2133 16GB/2Gx72 ECC/REG
* Hard Drive - Samsung 850 EVO 250GB 2.5-Inch SATA III Internal SSD
* Coolant - Corsair Hydro Series H100i v2
* Power Supply - EVGA 850 GQ, 80+ GOLD 850W, Semi Modular
* Case - Fractal Design MicroATX Define Mini C

All together it cost ~$1100. I went with a smaller amount of RAM and Hard Drive space because I can easily upgrade in the future.

I chose to go with a Xeon Processor over something like an i7 because of the longevity under a heavy load, the support for ECC memory, and I could get 8MB of cache at a cheaper price point. 


***Some Resources for Picking Hardware***

* [Building Energy Efficient ESXi Home Lab](https://www.vladan.fr/energy-efficient-esxi-home-lab) - Great blog, lots of resources for building a ESXi box.
* [Supermirco Motherboards](https://www.supermicro.com/products/motherboard/) - Look up specs and compatibility for Supermicro boards
* [Intel Product Specification](https://ark.intel.com/) - Look up specs for Intel products
* [Power Supply Calculator](http://www.coolermaster.com/power-supply-calculator/) - Make sure your PSU can support build
* [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) - Find cheapest place to buy a specific part
* [Friends and Co-Workers](#) - The best way to get information is to ask questions

The blog by Vladan Seget was an excellent starting place. I had very little knowledge to start with and it was a little overwhelming. The articles at vladan.fr helped me get started on the right path. 

Once I receive some parts, I will post pictures and updates.
