><br>This page contains posts about projects I am working on or have completed. The posts contain a description of the project, links to source code, and a little bit about my thought process during the project.<br>
 <br>
Personally, I learn more from articles that describe why the author did things a certain way, or that explain ideas the author had which did not work.
<br><br>
I will try to write my posts in this manner, to better help others learn.<br><br>
